# Netflix-Viewing-Trends-Recommendation-Analysis

Ever wondered how Netflix recommends your next binge-worthy show? In my latest project, I explored the patterns behind Netflix recommendations by analyzing movie attributes like release year, genres, and maturity ratings.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Analysis:
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
📌 Distribution of movie release years using histograms
📌 Genre popularity visualizations
📌 Maturity rating trends with box plots
🤖 Machine Learning for Recommendation Insights:
🔹 Built a predictive model using XGBoost to estimate movie maturity ratings
🔹 Achieved a 42.97% accuracy despite limited features
🔹 Explored feature importance to understand what drives recommendations

📊 Visualization & Interactive Insights:
🌟 Created an interactive dashboard displaying peak viewing hours, genre preferences, and content recommendation patterns

🚀 Future Scope:
🔹 Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) on recommendations
🔹 Experimenting with Deep Learning for better predictions
🔹 Enhancing the dataset with user preferences & engagement data

This project was a great dive into data analysis, visualization, and machine learning in the entertainment domain! 🎥📈
